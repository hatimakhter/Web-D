    <h1>Osman I</h1> <hr>
    <p>Osman I or Osman Ghazi (Ottoman Turkish: عثمان غازى, romanized:
       Osmān Ġāzī; Turkish: I. Osman or Osman Gazi; died 1323/4)[1][3][a]
       was the eponymous founder of the Ottoman Empire (first known as a beylik or emirate).
       While initially a small Turkoman[5] principality during Osman's lifetime, 
       his beylik transformed into a vast empire in the centuries after his death.[6]
       It existed until 1922 shortly after the end of World War I, when the sultanate was abolished.

    <h2>Historical background</h2> <hr>
    <p>Most sources agree that the Ottoman Turks belonged to the Kayı Oghuz Turkic clan,
       who, according to Ottoman traditions, fled their native homeland in Central Asia 
       during the early 13th century due to the Mongol invasions. The clan settled in 
       Anatolia, in a region belonging to the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm.[16] Other sources
       claim that the Kayı clan moved to Anatolia two centuries earlier than the previously
       mentioned date, alongside the Seljuks, when they left Transoxiana to Khurasan around
       1040 to reside near the city of Merv. Then, the Kayı clan moved towards eastern 
       Anatolia after 1071 CE,[17] where it displaced other Turkic clans. Later, it became 
       involved in the army of Sultan Kayqubad I and fought against the Khwarazmians, 
       Mongols and Byzantines, who were raiding Seljuk lands. According to several sources, 
       the Kayı warriors were known for filling first lines in battles, and their fighting 
       skills and bravery were among the major factors the Seljuks were victorious in many battles. 
       This fact prompted Sultan Kayqubad to appoint Ertuğrul, the clan's Emir, as a 
       Moqaddam (Lieutenant), and to reward the Kayıs some fertile lands near Ankara, 
       where they settled and remained in the service of the Sultan for several years.

    <h2>Lineage</h2> <hr>
    <p>Although the exact date of Osman's birth is unspecified, some sources indicate that 
       he was born on 13 February 1258, the exact same day the Mongol hordes invaded Baghdad, 
       killing its inhabitants and ravaging its landmarks.[22] Other sources, such as the 
       16th-century Ottoman historian Kemalpaşazâde, say that Osman was most likely born 
       around the middle of the 13th century, possibly in 1254/5.[23] Information related 
       to the early life of Osman is limited. However, the few available sources agree that 
       he was born in the town of Söğüt, which his father Ertuğrul took as the capital of his emirate
